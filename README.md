## Reinforcement Learning for Enhancing Financial Question-Answering with BART Project Overview

This project showcases the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to optimize financial question-answering capabilities using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model from Hugging Face. Focused on a targeted subset of 250 entries from a comprehensive dataset of 7,000, the project highlights how RL, coupled with a reward system for sentence coherence and fluency, significantly enhances the model's accuracy and relevance in generating precise responses within the financial domain.

## Data Selection and Preparation

Utilizing a carefully curated subset of a larger financial dataset, sourced under the Apache License 2.0, the project emphasizes critical "question" and "answer" fields pertinent to financial queries. Through meticulous tokenization and preprocessing facilitated by the transformers library, the dataset was structured to optimize compatibility with BART's advanced architecture, setting the stage for RL-driven training methodologies.

## Reinforcement Learning Approach

Central to the project's innovation is the strategic implementation of RL, incorporating a reward system tailored for sentence coherence and fluency. This approach enables the BART model to dynamically adjust its responses based on real-time feedback during training. By iteratively optimizing model parameters and policies, the system not only learns from the dataset but also autonomously refines its ability to generate contextually accurate and linguistically fluent answers.

## Potential Impact

The project underscores the transformative potential of RL-enhanced BART models in elevating decision-making processes within financial institutions. By prioritizing coherence and fluency in response generation, the system promises to streamline operations, enhance customer service standards, and provide actionable insights crucial for strategic financial analysis.
